        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p>
            At Roaders, we strive to provide our customers with a seamless and convenient experience. However, we understand that plans may change. Our cancellation policy is designed to ensure fairness to both our drivers and customers.
        </p>

        <h2>1. When Can You Cancel?</h2>
        <p>
            Cancellation is only allowed before the driver is booked. Once a driver is assigned to your booking, cancellation is no longer possible.
        </p>

        <h2>2. No Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Please note that no refunds will be provided after the driver is booked. All bookings are considered final once a driver has been assigned to your order.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How to Reach Us for Support?</h2>
